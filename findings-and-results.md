## Results: 
### 1. Time Spent on Platform

An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare time spent on the platform between Web and Android users. Levene’s test indicated equal variances, F(1, 5998) = 2.41, p = .12. There was a statistically significant difference in time spent, t(5998) = −25.39, p < .001. 
Android users spent significantly more time (M = 10.06 min, SD = 3.04) than Web users (M = 8.11 min, SD = 2.94). 
The mean difference was −1.96 min (95% CI [−2.11, −1.81]), supporting the alternate hypothesis (H₁).

### 2. Satisfaction Rating

An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare user satisfaction ratings. 
There was a significant difference, t(5814.55) = −23.22, p < .001, with Android users reporting higher satisfaction (M = 4.06, SD = 0.71) than Web users (M = 3.60, SD = 0.84).
The mean difference was −0.466 (95% CI [−0.505, −0.427]), supporting H₁.

### 3. Cart-to-Checkout Time

An independent-samples t-test compared time from cart to checkout.
There was a significant difference, t(5765.99) = 26.65, p < .001, with Web users taking longer (M = 177.84 s, SD = 60.19)
than Android users (M = 140.05 s, SD = 49.11).
The mean difference was 37.79 s (95% CI [35.01, 40.57]), supporting the alternate hypothesis.

### 4. Conversion
A chi-square test of independence was used to examine the relationship between platform and conversion status. 
The association was statistically significant, χ²(1, N = 6000) = 31.85, p < .001. 
Android users had a higher conversion rate (24.6%) than Web users (18.6%) This supported the alternate hypothesis.

## Interpretation
The results of the A/B test show that the newly launched Android app is performing very well compared to the Web store across the measured user metrics.

1. Users spend more time on the Android app, which suggests that the app is engaging and encourages them to explore more products. 
2. At the same time, user satisfaction is higher on the app, indicating that people find it easier and more enjoyable to use.

2. Another important finding is that checkout is faster on the Android app.
Users can move from adding items to completing their purchase more quickly than on the Web store,
which reduces friction and likely contributes to better conversion. 
4. The conversion rate itself is higher on the app, meaning more users are completing purchases when shopping through Android.

Taken together, these results suggest that the Android app not only improves the overall user experience 
but also has a direct positive impact on business outcomes, such as increased sales and user engagement.
